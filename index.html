        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite artist : JR JR</p>

        <p>I really like this band, because of its mixture of rock and pop with elements of hip hop, classical, and other genres.</p>
        <p>I am personal friends with one of the lead singers and they have written many popular songs such as the hit song "Gone".</p>
        <p>They like to use objects and digital effects for much of their music to give it a raw and unique sound that's both fun and groovy.</p>
